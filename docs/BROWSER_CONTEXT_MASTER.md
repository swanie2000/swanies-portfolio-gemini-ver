LEVEL 4 AI CONTROL HEADER — SWANIE'S PORTFOLIO
============================================================

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.

The browser AI does NOT have file access.
All decisions must be based ONLY on this document.

------------------------------------------------------------
ROLE ASSIGNMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

Android Studio Agent:
- Implementation agent
- Can see files
- Makes code changes

Browser AI:
- Architecture + reasoning advisor
- NEVER assumes files not listed here
- NEVER invents structure
- Must request files when needed

------------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY BEHAVIOR RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
1) NEVER make code changes unless the user explicitly asks for implementation.
2) DO NOT assume missing files.
3) If code detail is required, request:

   NEED FILE: path/to/file

4) Prefer minimal, safe edits.
5) Avoid large refactors unless explicitly asked.
6) Explain reasoning BEFORE suggesting code changes.

------------------------------------------------------------
SESSION START CHECKLIST (ALWAYS)
------------------------------------------------------------

Before giving advice, remind user to:

[ ] git pull
[ ] regenerate context dump if older than 24 hours
[ ] confirm working branch
[ ] verify this dump matches current files before major decisions

------------------------------------------------------------
WORKFLOW RULES
------------------------------------------------------------

- Context dump should be refreshed regularly.
- After milestones:
  remind user to commit + push.
- Browser AI gives guidance only.
- Studio agent performs edits.

------------------------------------------------------------
USER WORKING STYLE (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Provide FULL FILE outputs when code changes are needed.
- Avoid partial snippets unless requested.
- Give step-by-step instructions.
- Reduce complexity; avoid large rewrites.

------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL 4 MODE (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Act as a SENIOR REVIEWER.

CORE REVIEWER MINDSET (FINAL RULE):

Act as a SENIOR CODE REVIEWER first, not a code generator.

Your primary job is to:
- protect project stability
- detect risk early
- ask clarifying questions before changing architecture

Only generate code after explaining:
1) what risk you are avoiding
2) why the change is safe
3) why smaller options were rejected


Your default action is to REDUCE risk, not increase capability.

You should:
- detect risky ideas
- suggest smallest safe change
- prefer stability over cleverness
- protect project structure

ADDITIONAL SAFETY RULE (CRITICAL):

Before proposing ANY code change, the AI must:

1) Identify the SMALLEST POSSIBLE SAFE CHANGE.
2) Explain why this change is low-risk.
3) Avoid multi-file rewrites unless explicitly requested.
4) Prefer:
   - one file
   - one function
   - one behavior change at a time.

If the change affects architecture or more than 2 files:
- STOP
- ask user for confirmation first.

If uncertain:
ASK QUESTIONS instead of guessing.

------------------------------------------------------------
AGENT AUTHORITY ORDER (LEVEL 4 CORE RULE)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) REAL SOURCE OF TRUTH:
    - Actual files inside Android Studio project.

2) STUDIO AGENT:
    - Can inspect files.
    - Implementation authority.

3) THIS CONTEXT DUMP:
    - Snapshot of project state.
    - Used for browser AI reasoning.

4) BROWSER AI:
    - Advisory only.
    - Never overrides file reality.

If conflict exists between browser AI advice and real files:
REAL FILES ALWAYS WIN.

------------------------------------------------------------
SESSION END CHECKLIST (ALWAYS)
------------------------------------------------------------

Before ending a session or after a major milestone,
the AI should remind the user to:

[ ] regenerate context dump if major changes were made
[ ] update narrative section if architecture changed
[ ] git add / commit / push
[ ] confirm current branch
[ ] note next-step tasks for the next session
[ ] ask if user wants to save a short "next session plan"

AI behavior rule:
- Do NOT silently end a workflow.
- Ask: "Do you want to run the end-of-session checklist?"

Confirm you understand the Level-4 rules and reviewer mindset before giving advice.

DO NOT START PROCESSING ANYTHING UNTIL THE USER CONFIRMS.!!!!!!!!!!!!

USER WORKING STYLE (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------------------

- Provide FULL FILE outputs when code changes are needed.
- Avoid partial snippets unless requested.
- Give step-by-step instructions.
- Reduce complexity; avoid large rewrites.

NARRATIVE SECTION (SOURCE FILE - EDIT docs/BROWSER_CONTEXT_NARRATIVE.md)
============================================================
### BEGIN_NARRATIVE
SWANIES PORTFOLIO: MASTER NARRATIVE (V40.63: RELEASE READINESS CHECKLIST + LAUNCH TRACK)

V40.63 PLAN (Play Console + RevenueCat Release Readiness)
- Account setup: Activate Play Developer profile; finalize package/app record; complete contact + policy fields.
- Billing wiring: Create Play subscription base plans and map them to RevenueCat offerings/packages; verify `pro` entitlement mapping.
- Validation matrix: Test Free/Active Pro/Grace/Expired/Restored states and verify all gated surfaces + widget behavior.
- Compliance readiness: Data safety, content rating, audience declarations, listing assets, and release notes.
- Rollout control: Internal -> Closed track progression with 48-72h monitoring for crashes/ANRs/purchase/restore health before wider rollout.

NEXT SESSION START (EXECUTION ORDER)
- 1) Play product setup + RevenueCat mapping verification.
- 2) Internal track upload + tester matrix run.
- 3) Store/compliance completion + launch readiness decision.

V40.62 UPDATE (Warnings Burn-Down + Lint Zero Lock)
- `:app:lintDebug` now reports **0 errors / 0 warnings** (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- Cleared `UseKtx` and `ModifierParameter` buckets with safe code-level fixes (KTX extensions, composable parameter ordering, lambda `offset` for state-backed values).
- Removed dead lint-flagged resources and unused colors, then revalidated compile/lint stability.
- Added `app/lint.xml` to suppress non-functional advisory categories so lint remains a regression signal.
- Outcome: lint gate is fully green and stable for next release-prep work.

FUTURE PATH (NEXT TRACK)
- Decide whether to keep current lint policy or re-enable suppressed categories incrementally.
- Continue Play/RevenueCat validation on internal track with Free/Active Pro/Expired Pro matrix checks.

V40.61 UPDATE (Lint Error Burn-Down + Translation Completion)
- `:app:lintDebug` reduced from ~69 errors to **0 errors** (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`), while warnings remain visible for future cleanup.
- Fixed `ContextCastToActivity` pattern by switching to `LocalActivity.current as FragmentActivity` in `HomeScreen`, `NavGraph`, `UnlockVaultScreen`, `RestoreVaultScreen`, and `PortfolioManagerScreen`.
- Resolved `UnusedBoxWithConstraintsScope` in `HoldingsUIComponents` by replacing unused `BoxWithConstraints` with `Box`.
- Completed real translations for new monetization/pro-gate/settings + `analytics_premium_*` keys across all maintained locale files.
- Added missing `terms_section_*` + `terms_last_updated` translations for locales flagged by lint (`de`, `fr`, `ar`, `ja`).

FUTURE PATH (NEXT TRACK)
- Play Developer registration → subscription SKUs → RC offerings → internal/closed testing; Data safety + privacy policy + listing prep in parallel.
- V40.62 candidate: monetization telemetry, Free/Pro/expired matrix validation, paywall copy polish.
- Choose warning strategy: gradual cleanup vs lint baseline for CI-on-regressions.

V40.60 UPDATE (Localization, Holdings Reorder Fix, Auth/Lint Hygiene, Launch Path)
- **Pro analytics live strings (`analytics_live_*`):** Real translations for **`values-vi`**, **`values-zh-rCN`**, **`values-zh-rTW`** aligned to `AnalyticsProLivePages.kt` keys (plus ongoing locale wave).
- **Holdings reorder crash:** `MyHoldingsScreen` — `onMove` now applies **`holdingsLazyListStartIndex`** (`0` Pro / `1` free with upsell banner) because `sh.calvin.reorderable` uses absolute `LazyColumn` indices; bounds-checked before list mutation. Verified free + Pro.
- **`CreateAccountScreen`:** `LocalActivity.current as FragmentActivity` for `hiltViewModel` (AndroidX guidance).
- **Build:** `:app:mergeDebugResources` + `:app:compileDebugKotlin` green. **`lintDebug`** still has broader legacy issues (`MissingTranslation`, etc.) — separate track.
- **Product clarity:** RevenueCat = entitlements + orchestration; **Google Play** = store checkout when distributing on Play — keep both.

V40.59 UPDATE (Analytics Premium Live Engines + Modular Refactor)
- Live premium engines for `RISK`, `ATTRIBUTION`, `REBALANCE`, `SCENARIOS`; split `AnalyticsProUpsellPages.kt` / `AnalyticsProLivePages.kt` / `AnalyticsProUiComponents.kt`; compile-stable.

V40.58 UPDATE (Analytics Premium Experience + Upgrade Flow UX)
- Reworked Analytics into a mixed-access model: free chart pages remain available, while Pro insights are presented as premium teaser pages with upgrade entry points.
- Added swipe-first analytics page flow with compact chart/list layout and a dedicated `START` instructional page for clearer onboarding.
- Standardized premium visuals across monetization surfaces via shared `ProPalette` tokens and reusable `ProLockBadge` treatment.
- Upgraded Pro analytics content into larger in-page ad panels and finalized CTA behavior to a single full-width `UPGRADE TO PRO` action.
- Improved `UPGRADE TO PRO` page usability by surfacing an immediate back action near the primary purchase action.
- Verified stability through repeated `:app:compileDebugKotlin` successes during iterative UI refinement.

V40.57 UPDATE (RevenueCat Stabilization + Access Enforcement)
- Added RevenueCat app-user identity synchronization before restore/purchase/offering calls to reduce anonymous entitlement drift.
- Upgraded restore outcomes to deterministic user-facing statuses (`already active`, `restored`, `no entitlement`, `failed`).
- Split monetization into dedicated routes (`UPGRADE TO PRO NOW`, `TEST INFO`) and improved settings flow clarity.
- Enforced Free-tier holdings restrictions to prevent multi-vault swipe access without Pro and added contextual upgrade upsell entry.

V40.56 UPDATE (RevenueCat Monetization Wiring + Pro Gating)
- Integrated RevenueCat Android SDK and app startup initialization with safe no-key fallback behavior.
- Added a centralized monetization layer (`MonetizationManager`) with entitlement refresh, restore, offerings fetch, and purchase methods.
- Gated paid surfaces behind Pro entitlement: Theme Manager, Multiple Portfolios, Analytics, and Widget Manager configuration flow.
- Built a reusable Pro gate screen with package selection, upgrade action, restore purchases, retry plan load, and manage subscription deep link.
- Added Settings monetization diagnostics: Pro status, RevenueCat configured flag, loaded plan count, expected entitlement/offering IDs, and checklist copy action.
- Hardened configuration targeting with explicit `REVENUECAT_PRO_ENTITLEMENT` and `REVENUECAT_OFFERING_ID` build fields.

V40.55 UPDATE (RevenueCat Monetization Plan + Execution Start)
- Locked monetization direction to RevenueCat with a staged rollout path that protects current app stability.
- Defined product model: one `pro` entitlement, monthly/yearly subscriptions, and a future one-time lifetime SKU path.
- Planned implementation sequence: SDK bootstrap -> entitlement state layer -> gated Pro surfaces -> purchase/restore UX -> telemetry + staged release checks.
- Added launch guardrails: no hard paywall before restore/account edge-case validation, and centralized billing logic behind one repository boundary.
- Started execution by introducing an in-app monetization boundary layer so RevenueCat wiring can be added safely without touching feature logic.

V40.52 UPDATE (Settings UX Stabilization)
- Shifted app-wide font scaling from hard lock to capped scaling (`coerceAtMost(1.40f)`) to preserve readability while limiting overshoot.
- Fixed language-picker first-selection race by persisting language code before activity recreation.
- Normalized key Settings labels to all-caps for visual consistency and changed `REPORT TRANSLATION ISSUE` to `REPORT TRANSLATION`.
- Resolved two-line clipping for the translation call-to-action area by replacing button chrome with full-width clickable text and explicit line-height handling.

V40.50 UPDATE (Localization Finalization)
- Completed direct, new-data translation cleanup for `values-hi`, `values-th`, `values-uk`, and `values-zh-rTW`.
- Resolved remaining English fallback blocks on auth/settings/terms/holdings surfaces for those locales.
- Preserved formatting tokens (`%1$s`, `%1$d`) and validated UTF-8 readability.
- Verified compile sanity with `:app:compileDebugKotlin` (BUILD SUCCESSFUL).

    FULL FILE OUTPUTS ONLY: Swanie requires full file context. Partial snippets are forbidden unless explicitly requested.

    SOVEREIGN SHIELD: Never push local.properties, secrets, or API keys. Enforce .gitignore discipline.

That path was removed.
      - The user opens the editor only from the home widget (Glance pencil): [WidgetClickCallback] starts [WidgetConfigActivity] with [AppWidgetManager.EXTRA_APPWIDGET_ID] (and a relay URI for anti-conflation).

    Activity + manifest contract:
      - [WidgetConfigActivity] is `android:exported="false"` and has **no** `<intent-filter>`. It is not launchable as a generic `APPWIDGET_CONFIGURE` target from the system.
      - If `appWidgetId` is missing or invalid after [resolveAppWidgetId], the activity calls `finish()` immediately ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â no portfolio picker, no multi-widget dialog, no inference from ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“any widget on the host.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â

    Wizard Funnel layout ([WidgetManagerScreen]):
      - Funnel navigation uses integer page state (`currentPage`): `0=SETUP`, `1=ASSETS`, `2=STYLE`, `3=PREVIEW`.
      - **SETUP**: portfolio selector + show total control.
      - **ASSETS**: sticky header + flat reorder stage with persisted ordering.
      - **STYLE**: compact color studio controls.
      - **PREVIEW**: guarded preview path with immutable snapshot filtering and fallback error surface.

      - After drag stop, a short settle delay (`WIDGET_DRAG_SETTLE_DELAY_MS` = 380 ms) runs before persisting order via [AssetViewModel.updateWidgetSelectionForCurrentVault].

    Tactile reorder UX (unchanged):
      - Long-press on the asset row handle initiates drag; haptics on drag start; persistence on drag end after settle.

    Save pipeline:
      - [AssetViewModel.saveWidgetConfiguration] persists vault widget fields (including optional `appWidgetId` rebind), pushes Glance data via [AssetRepository.pushFreshAssetsToWidget], and sends [ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE] for the affected instance(s).
      - [SettingsViewModel] still applies appearance and totals (`saveWidgetAppearance`, `updateShowWidgetTotal`) and may call `forceImmediateRemoteViewsUpdate` for instant RemoteViews feedback.

    Primary completion behavior ([WidgetConfigActivity]):
      - On **SAVE & EXIT** success and on **back**, the activity uses **`finishAndRemoveTask()`** as the primary way to tear down the translucent config task and return the user cleanly to the home screen, alongside the post-save broadcast so the launcher-bound widget redraws with the same `appWidgetId` the pencil supplied.

    Vault-scoped truth (unchanged):
      - Canonical widget fields live on [VaultEntity]: `selectedWidgetAssets`, `showWidgetTotal`, widget colors, `appWidgetId`.
      - [AssetViewModel.widgetSelectedAssetIds] / `setWidgetSelectionVaultId` keep selection aligned with the vault being edited.

    Widget Manager Screen:
      - [SettingsViewModel]: `targetVaultId` / `targetVault` / `targetVaultAssets` for the resolved vault.
      - [AssetViewModel]: ordered selection, toggles, drag-end persistence, and `saveWidgetConfiguration` on save.

      - PREVIEW stability guard:
        - Uses immutable list snapshot (`orderedWidgetAssets.toList()` then filter/take).
        - Uses data-prep `runCatching` gate; renders **"Preview Error"** fallback on preparation failure.
        - Uses static simulated rows (`SimulatedAssetRow`) with hardcoded price/total strings to isolate render-path crashes.
      - Known next-debug target:
        - If PREVIEW still hard-crashes on some devices, first inspect launcher/Activity lifecycle boundary around widget config return and any stale Compose state entering page `3`.

    AssetViewModel contract (widget slice):
      - `saveWidgetConfiguration(portfolioVaultId, appWidgetId, selectedIds, onComplete)` is the save entry used from the widget manager.
      - Ongoing edits still use `updateWidgetSelectionForCurrentVault`, `pushAssetsToWidget` / `pushFreshAssetsToWidget` as appropriate.

    Authentication architecture:
      - Auth ownership is unified to shared activity-scoped [AuthViewModel] across Home, Unlock, NavGraph, Create, Restore, and Portfolio Manager surfaces.
      - Login path is deterministic: `HOME -> UNLOCK_VAULT -> HOLDINGS`.
      - Removed unintended direct auth bypass behaviors from startup/resume and login entry routines.

    Session controls:
      - Login timeout is user-configurable: `Never`, `15s`, `30s`, `60s`, `5m`, `15m`.
      - Timeout enforcement now uses true user-leave signal (`onUserLeaveHint`) to avoid false lockouts during system overlays.
      - Orientation is locked to portrait at [MainActivity] manifest contract.

    Credential + biometric reliability:
      - Password verification accepts normalized identity input against username/displayName/email.
      - Biometric prompt copy and error messages are user-friendly and deterministic.
      - Safety control added: `Require Password After Biometric Failure` (default ON).
      - Biometric login CTA is exposed only when `Allow biometrics for login` is enabled in Settings.

    UX polish:
      - Unlock header aligned with app style (`PORTFOLIO LOCKED`, swan-first layout).
      - CTA language simplified and standardized (`LOGIN`, `USE BIOMETRICS`, `CREATE ACCOUNT`).
      - Settings security copy simplified for non-technical readability.

    - Do NOT reintroduce automatic auth bypass on app resume.
    - Do NOT set background timeout stamps from generic lifecycle edges that can fire during overlays (`onStop`).
    - Do NOT expose biometric login button when `Allow biometrics for login` is disabled.
    - Do NOT split auth state ownership across multiple screen-scoped auth viewmodels.
    - Do NOT remove `Never` from login timeout options.
    - Do NOT bypass `UNLOCK_VAULT` from HOME login flow for standard credentialed login.
    - Do NOT silently swallow biometric errors; surface user-friendly messages.
    - Do NOT break portrait lock in `MainActivity` manifest contract.

      - Persist user language preference and apply locale at app startup.
    - Subscription objective:
      - Define entitlement matrix for `Trial`, `Paid`, and `Premium`.
      - Enforce tier-gated feature behavior with safe downgrade handling.
    - Profile/schema objective:
      - Track language and tier preferences (`language_setting`, `user_tier`) in the user profile model.
      - Reflect entitlement + language controls in account/settings UX.
    - Recommended sequence:
      1) Localization foundation,
      2) Tier/entitlement matrix,

      - Debug Kotlin compile passed after rollout.

NEXT AGENT COMMAND
"The narrative is now V40.46: Top-20 Language Expansion + Translation Feedback Intake.

Current Objective: Continue localization rollout by adding resource bundles for prioritized Top-20 locales and applying translation parity checks while preserving V40.46 picker/feedback and existing auth/session guardrails.

Constraint: Keep changes minimal and safe. Maintain Sovereign Shield. Confirm 'SOVEREIGN LOCK' before any architectural shift."

    - Locale bundle expansion:
      - Added 17 new locale resource directories to complete Top-20 selection coverage:
        `ar`, `de`, `fr`, `hi`, `id`, `it`, `ja`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt-BR`, `ru`, `th`, `tr`, `uk`, `vi`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`.
    - Parity hardening:
      - Per-locale `strings.xml` files were backfilled to include all keys present in base English bundle.
      - Preserved Phase 1 translated high-visibility text while inheriting remaining keys for deterministic fallback behavior.
    - Stability outcome:
      - Prevents missing-key resource failures and hidden fallback drift in top-20 language paths.
      - Establishes safe foundation for iterative translation-quality passes without runtime risk.
    - Validation:
      - Debug Kotlin compile passed after parity completion.

NEXT AGENT COMMAND
"The narrative is now V40.47: Localization Phase 2 (Top-20 Key Parity).

Current Objective: Execute translation quality pass by replacing inherited English placeholders in new locale bundles, prioritize auth/home/settings/terms surfaces first, and preserve V40.47 parity guarantees.

Constraint: Keep changes minimal and safe. Maintain Sovereign Shield. Confirm 'SOVEREIGN LOCK' before any architectural shift."

    - Scope:
      - Completed quality-focused translation passes across all 17 new locale bundles introduced in V40.47.
    - Batch A:
      - Auth core string upgrades (`FORGOT PASSWORD?`, `VERIFYING...`, `DONE`).
    - Batch B:
      - Recovery/auth error and hint-flow messaging upgrades.
    - Batch C:
      - Create-account and security settings copy upgrades.
    - Batch D:
      - Terms heading and translation-feedback UI copy upgrades (CTA/title/subtitle/submit/chooser/no-email).
    - Result:
      - Stronger native phrasing on high-traffic auth/settings/terms surfaces while retaining key parity guarantees.
    - Validation:
      - Debug Kotlin compile passed after batch rollout; lint remained clean on touched resource files.

Constraint: Keep changes minimal and safe. Maintain Sovereign Shield. Confirm 'SOVEREIGN LOCK' before any architectural shift."

21. V40.49 - LOCALIZATION REPAIR + MASTER-TEXT STABILIZATION

    - Emergency repair pass:
      - Repaired locale bundles that were unintentionally re-saved with wrong text encoding.
      - Restored Korean and other affected language files to valid UTF-8 content and revalidated readability.
    - Translation continuity:
      - Preserved Top-20 locale parity while replacing corrupted placeholders with stable localized text where available.
      - Kept English base bundle as legal/master fallback for unresolved phrases.
    - Process hardening:
      - Localization batch workflows now require UTF-8-safe reads/writes to prevent future mojibake/corruption.
      - Manual review checkpoint is required before bulk locale script runs.
    - Validation:
      - Debug Kotlin compile passed after repair and stabilization.

NEXT AGENT COMMAND
"The narrative is now V40.49: Localization Repair + Master-Text Stabilization.

Current Objective: Continue incremental translation quality improvements with UTF-8-safe tooling, prioritize remaining English placeholders by high-traffic screen, and preserve repaired locale integrity.
