READ-ONLY SCAN + NARRATIVE REFRESH TASK (NO CODE CHANGES)

Goal:
Update the human-readable narrative sections of my browser context
system so new browser AIs understand the project correctly.

Rules:
- DO NOT modify code.
- DO NOT refactor.
- Only read and report what exists.

Output ONLY the following sections, ready to paste into a doc:

1) PROJECT OVERVIEW (purpose, architecture, key libraries, versions if found)
2) CURRENT APP FLOW (startup -> screens -> data flow)
3) KEY FILE INDEX (high-signal files only; file path + purpose)
4) KNOWN PROBLEMS / RISKS (only what you can infer from code)
5) CURRENT FEATURE STATUS (implemented vs not)

Keep it accurate, specific, and based on files.
If you need to read files not already open, say which ones.
